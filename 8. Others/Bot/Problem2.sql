--Table: Products

+----------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
+----------------+---------+
-- | product_id | int |
-- | low_fats | enum |
-- | recyclable | enum |
-- | organic | enum |
-- | eco_friendly | enum |
+----------------+---------+

--   product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
--   low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means the product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
--   recyclable is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means the product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
--   organic is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means the product is organic and 'N' means it is not.
--   eco_friendly is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means the product is environmentally friendly and 'N' means it is not.

-- Write a Solution:

-- Find the product_id of products that meet one of the following conditions:

--    The product is both low fat and recyclable.
--    The product is either organic or eco-friendly but not both.

-- Return the result table in any order.
-- Example 1:

-- Input:
