# SQL 50

Just some queries from practice. The source is LeetCode. I am practicing to "sharpening the saw". My goal is to return to levels that I have already learned and experienced. The queries are separated in folders(as seen in LeetCode). All the queries are in MySQL
- Select 
- Basic 
- Basic Aggregate Functions
- Sorting and Grouping
- Advanced Select and Joins
- Subqueries
- Advanced String Functions / Regex / Clause
